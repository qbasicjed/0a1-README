# 0a1-README

This is the home of all programs made by Jordan E. Dunlap which he[I] has chosen to make public.
At some future point, the endeaver is to point out certain sections of code to highlight 
certain capabilities.

Languages:  The most likely languages to be used at this point are C++, Java, and VB.

History:  I started programming in fall 2008 in 9th grade using QBASIC.  Since then, I have persued
          programming and other related tasks.  I proceeded to learn VB 2010 shortly after with
          much enthusiasm.  Later in high school, I was introduced to ROBOTC.  I used a LEGO NXT 
          [(TM)(C) or whatever I need to put here] to program with sensors, motors, and screen output.
          In college, I was introduced to HTML5, CSS3, Java, Perl, Javascript, PHP, C++, MATLAB, R, MASM, and Fortran.  Each
          has its own style, filled with different particular flavors of logic.
